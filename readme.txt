We were not able to implement an obstacle avoidance algorithm. We make the boids go through the tunnel one by one or just
as the leader goes through, they follow the leader. Due to different flocking algorithms, the three groups performed differently.
Scalable moved as a group as a circle and the size of the circle depended on the number of boids. Emergent followed a front leader,
but did not follow as a specific shape. Two level was a bit wonky as the leader wasn't actually there and but the boids tried to
follow the "leader".
